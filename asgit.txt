Consumers continue to flee from cellphone contracts
New York Times covered an interesting survey showing that consumers are actively looking to downgrade their cellphone contracts to save money.
39% of Americans are likely to downgrade their plan to save money
26% are thinking of switching to pre-paid or pay-as-you-go to get away from contracts
15% have already cut back on expensive features
Peekonomics 101 shows how you can do exactly what many consumers are doing - save money on your cellphone bill while staying in-touch on the go.  So how many Peeksters out there have cut back on their cellphone bill?

Welcome to Peekonomics!
Hey there blogosphere - welcome to Peekonomics. This is a new section of our blog designed to help explain the mysterious world of cell phone bills and charges.
Right now consumers and businesses everywhere are looking for ways to cut their costs and one obvious target are these expensive cell phone bills. But - as always - its a *nightmare* to figure out exactly what all your cell phone services cost and - more importantly - to compare the alternatives.
To help solve this problem weve created Peekonomics.com. Its a fun animated site that lets you compare the cost of getting unlimited email and texting on your Peek to getting it with one of the four major carriers.  As the site shows the potential savings are pretty big - especially over the life of a two year contract. Check it out and let us know what you think.

Lifetime offer returns at Costco.com!
To celebrate the launch of Peekonomics.com, the popular Peek for Life offer is once again available for a limited time over at Costco.com.  Imagine - a Peek device plus unlimited email and texting for life for less than what emailing and texting will cost you for a year at AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile.  Crazy but true!
PS - We havent forgotten about you Peeksters.  You can upgrade your service for $349.  Just give our Care team at 877-677-PEEK.

Frugalista Peekonomics
Go check your mail (yes, this is a blog talking.)
Costco just sent millions and millions of people their monthly mailer with a stunning Peek deal. Buy a Peek for a flat price and use it to text and email forever with no monthly cost.
Why?
We did it to drive home Peekonomics 101. Peek helps you stay connected while saving a bundle of money.
Seems like folks are catching on to the whole save money angle with their cell phones (NYT: sayonara $100 bill and multi-year contracts). But does that mean adios emails-on-the-run and texting-in-whole-sentences and updating your Facebook? Nope.
Saving money aint just for pay-as-you-go phones. You can go frugalista on the smartphone front as well.
Your easy peasey, slim and award-winning Peek will save you hundreds of dollars vs. paying for the cell phone companys data plans, texting plans, taxes, activation fees, contracts, and gotchas.
Our everyday low price is just $49 for a Peek and just $19 per month for the unlimited texting and emailing.
Do the math. Really. You are probably falling for their nonsense even now. To help you art students: here is the math
Peekonomics 101. Go to class.

Cut the contracts , save money
A very fine article in the New York Times today discusses how folks are dumping cell phone contracts in favor of pay-as-you-go plans in order to save money. Of course, Peek is a way to get the best smartphone features  big screen, keypad, easy to email  without the costly commitments. So you know we agree!

Peek stimulus package
Dear Peeksters,
We know that these are tough times. Folks everywhere are looking for ways to save money. Since that matters to us too and were always looking for new ways to spread the word about Peek, we thought: what about combining these goals?
So weve come up with a little list of things that you could do that would be good for you and good for us. Of course you dont have to do any of these things, but if youd like to save some money read on.
1. Tell a friend about Peek.
For every friend or family member you speak to who becomes a Peekster, well give you two free months service. Well also give your friend a months free service. Everyones a winner!
All you have to do is email us at friends@getpeek.com after your friend has activated their account and tell us their email address. Theres no limit to this offer  i.e if 3 of your friends become Peeksters that would be half a year of free service for you!
2. Pay 12 months in advance.
Our 12 month pre-paid option is just $199.95. This means that your service will be only $16.66 per month. Over the year youll save almost $40 by paying in advance. Just click here to buy this plan.
http://www.12months.getpeek.com
3. Visit Target
The next time youre at your local Target store, ask for the Electronics Department Manager. If she or he is there, tell them how much you love your Peek. Also mention that Peek is doing a survey for all Target Electronics staff. All they have to do is go to http://target.getpeek.com and take the quick survey. Theyll get a $25 Starbucks gift card and well give YOU three months free Peek service!
To get your three months free service just email us at friends@getpeek.com and tell us the Electronics Department Managers name, which Target Store they work at, and what day you visited the store.
Peek is already great value, but with any of these actions, you could save even more money. In fact you could easily make your Peek service free! Hope you have a great weekend.
Happy Peeking!
Amol,
Peekster-in-Chief

Peeking is a bargain  especially with baby in the house
One customer raves about the value  Peek saves the day with baby in the house. (Peek is normally just $19,95 for unlimited email and textingwhile most data plans are $40? plus taxes and fees and often also SMS charges.)

Ive been using a Peek for a couple of months and I love it! In fact, I recently sold my iPhone and transferred my contract to someone else and use the Peek for all my texting and email.
My wife and I just had our third daughter and we have been looking for ways to trim an already lean budget. Today I saw that Peek was offering a lifetime service with the purchase of a new Peek. I called customer care and asked if I could upgrade. $219 later I had the lifetime service with my existing Peek.
With AT&T I paid roughly $40 a month for my email and texting plan. Over two years thats $960. Now, thanks to Peek Ill pay $220 over the next two years.
That extra $740 will come in handy with diapers,formula, etc.
Thanks again for a great device at a great value!

What a deal
Hey, we read the newspaper. These are tough times out there and people are looking for ways to save money.
We think a lot about ways to make Peek an even smarter value thats also simple to use and super stylish. Thats why we made it such a low cost device to buy, with no contract obligation, and a tiny monthly fee.
But in our quest to make it a better and better dealwe decided to give one of our customers interesting suggestions a whirl. Were just another one of those high-tech, fast-moving companies, I guess.
Amol, Peekster-in-Chief
Update: After 24 hours, boy oh boy did people like that Peek for Life! Well, we want you to be Peeksters for life too! We think the low, low up front price of $79 with no long term obligations is a great deal. Did you know you get a big discount if you buy a year of the service fee up front? 12 months for the price of 10. But we are going to keep looking for ways to save Peeksters money!

The Ugly Truth About Text Messaging
The New York Times did a very informative piece about text messaging: cell phone carriers charge you a lot for something that costs them about as close to zilch as anything out there. Nothing! And they charge $15-20 per month for the privilege of sending unlimited messages.
Peek doesnt charge anything extra for unlimited texting. You get your Peek, type the phone number you want to send to, hit send. It goes there right away. They reply, it comes to your Peek. Thats it!

Small businesses are Peeksters too!
We designed Peek to be the best personal mobile email solution available. What we didnt expect was that lots of small businesses would fall in love with Peek too.
It seems that ease of use, affordability and great service matters to everyone  which, of course, were thrilled to hear  because thats what we believe too!
Heres what Mike from Pinnacle Exteriors had to say about his companys Peek experience:
We use the Peek devices for our lead generation team to send in new sales leads to our office.  The ease of use of the devices is our main concern for the application we were looking to fill, and Peek supplied that perfectly.  This allowed us to standardize our method of communication, and both increase efficiency and decrease the workload of our confirming department who would otherwise have to stop what they were doing and answer phones to take new leads.
I highly recommend choosing Peek if you need an easy method of e-mail communication on the go, both for their devices, and for the fact that they seem to genuinely care for what their customers think Something often lost when working with most cellular companies.
Were planning to add some features and some other cool stuff to make Peek even better for small businesses. Let us know what you think. If youre a small business thinking about Peek  feel free to post here or contact us directly  wed love to hear from you. Contact rob@getpeek.com

Peekster Pandemonium update
Congrats to the UNC Tarheels - they cut down the nets last night in Detroit and stand atop the men’s college basketball world today.
This also brings Peekster Pandemonium to a close.  Leslie D. took home the crown with an impressive 51 of 63 picks correct.  19 other Peeksters in our little pool also managed to beat our Chief Peekster Amol’s picks.  Things were looking bleak for a moment there as Amol was near the bottom of the pack but he correctly picked UNC as the champion which vaulted him up the rankings.  And finally, a few dozen of you emailed us with the correct pick of UNC as the champion.
We’ll be in touch over the coming days with details on how to redeem your various prizes.  Thanks for participating in the inaugural Peekster Pandemonium - see you next year!

What do bricks and Ellen have in common?
Our brave Peekster of the week is Ellen.  A mother of 3 and a Peek Crash Test pilot. Ellen has sacrificed the ultimate to help beta test the Peek Pronto; she bricked her Peek.  We’re still refining the upgrade process and while Ellen was performing the update she was hit by friendly fire (not sure there’s such a thing as friendly fire!).  Ellen isn’t super technical but she volunteered to beta test to try out the new Peek features and we are grateful for that.
Thanks Ellen and sorry about your Peek.  We will fix it up and have it back to you in a jiffy.
Quick update - we just received Ellen’s Peek and for those of you fretting, it was recovered without a hitch. Also, check out the mysterious Velcro addition on the back. We wonder what it’s for. Any ideas?
If you’ve done some cool modifications to your Peek send the photo’s to gabe @ getpeek.com. We will feature them on the blog.

Smartphones = Badphones?
We Peeksters have always preferred real phones over ’smartphones’ — mainly because we need to talk on our phones! And smartphones aren’t so hot.
Here in the New York Times, they actually give a name to that phenomenon: The iPhone Excuse. Can’t hear my? Oh, that’s my iPhone… Peeks don’t have that problem!
Also, check out this piece for the insanely expensive $600 iPhone if you choose not to commit to spending $80-100 with them per month for 2 years.
